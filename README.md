# NeetCode 150 - LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **NeetCode 150** problems, a curated list of essential coding problems for technical interviews. The course is provided by **@DestinationFAANG** and available on **freeCodeCamp.org**.

## 📌 About the Course

- The NeetCode 150 course includes **150 important coding problems** that cover major algorithmic patterns commonly asked in FAANG and other top tech company interviews.
- Problems are selected to ensure strong **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** understanding.

## 🚀 My Approach

- Solving each problem using **C++** and **Python**.
- Writing clean and well-documented code.
- Tracking my progress with checklists.
- Adding explanations and edge case handling.
